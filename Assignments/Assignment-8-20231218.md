# Assignment #8 - 20231218 - Applying WoT, DT and Agents
- **Description:** The objective of the assignment is to apply in practice software architectures for pervasive systems as seen in module-3.2, using the technologies discussed in [Lab-12-20231218](https://github.com/pslab-unibo/sap-2023-2024/blob/master/Labs/Lab-12-20231218/README.md). To this purpose:

	- Consider the e-Scooter case study, or your own case study
	- Identify parts that can be designed in terms of WoT, Digital Twins and Software Agents
	
	- Provide a prototype implementation using the technologies suggested during the lab (or, your own proposed technology)

- **Deliverable**:  
	- Github repo including a report and the source code, organised in a proper way
