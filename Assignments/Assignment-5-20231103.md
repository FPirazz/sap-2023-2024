#### Software Architecture and Platforms - a.y. 2023-2024
 
# Assignment #5 - 20231103 - From Monolith to Microservices
- **Description:** The objective of the assignment is to develop a [microservices-based architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k6xXXp0fw8D9ufqlhcAXV89_oFeVUlq98-pT0MtbHM0/edit?usp=sharing) for the EScooters case study, eventually decomposing the monololith proposed in Assignment #3. The proposed solution:
	- should adopt at least 2 different technologies for implementing the microservices (e.g., some microservices can be implemented in Vert.x, others in Spring)
	- should consider and apply the microservices patterns that appear useful for the case study
	- should be properly described and documented
	
- **Deliverable**:  
	- Github repo including a report and the source code, organised in a proper way 

- **Deadlines**
	- November 17 (just for submitting the text file pointing to the repo)  
 
 - **Remarks**
	- This is a *mandatory* assignment for those who choose to do the practical part of the exam using assignments
