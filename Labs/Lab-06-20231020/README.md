# Software Architecture and Platforms - a.y. 2023-2024

## Lab #06-20231020 - [Repo](https://github.com/pslab-unibo/sap-2023-2024.git) 

In the previous lab [20231016](https://github.com/pslab-unibo/sap-2023-2024/blob/master/Labs/Lab-05-20231016/README.md) we focused on the hexagonal/ports & adapters architecture, which can be considered still a monolithic architecture. In this lab:

- We start working with [Microservices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k6xXXp0fw8D9ufqlhcAXV89_oFeVUlq98-pT0MtbHM0/edit?usp=sharing), a reference distributed (non monolithic) architecture used nowadays for engineering complex distributed systems

Activity 

- First discussion about a microservices based design for the EScooter case study
